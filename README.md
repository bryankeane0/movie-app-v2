## Overview.

[A brief statement on the content of this repository.]

### Features.
[ A bullet-point list of the __new features__ you added to the Movies Fan app (and any modifications to existing features) .]
 
+ Feature 1
+ Feature 2
+ Feature 3
+ etc

## Installation Requirements

Describe what needs to be on the machine to run the API (Node v?, NPM, MongoDB instance, any other 3rd party software not in the package.json). 

Describe getting/installing the software, perhaps:

```bat
git clone http:\myrepo.git
```

followed by installation

```bat
git install
```

## API Configuration
Describe any configuration that needs to take place before running the API. For example, creating an ``.env`` and what variables to put in it. Give an example of how this might be structured/done.
REMEMBER: DON'T PUT YOUR OWN USERNAMES/PASSWORDS/AUTH KEYS IN THE README OR ON GITHUB, just placeholders as indicated below:

```bat
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=8080
HOST=
mongoDB=YourMongoURL
seedDb=true
secret=YourJWTSecret
```

## API endpoints.

[ List the __additional__ TMDB endpoints used, giving the description and pathname for each one.] 

e.g.
+ Discover list of movies - discover/movie
+ Movie details - movie/:id
+ Movie genres = /genre/movie/list

## App Design.

### Component catalogue.

[ Insert a screenshot from the Storybook UI that lists all the stories for the app's components, and highlight those relating to your __new/modified components__ - see the example screenshot below.] .......

### UI Design.

[ Insert screenshots of the __new/modified app pages__ you developed (and modified existing pages), Include an appropriate caption for each one (see example below).

![ ](./images/view.png)

[ List the __new routes__ supported by your app and state the associated page.]

+ /blogs - displays all published blogs.
+ /blogs/:id - displays a particular blog.
+ /blogs/:id/comments - detail view of a particular blog and its comments.
+ etc.

[If relevant, state what aspects of your app are protected (i.e. require authentication) and what is public.]

## Independent learning (If relevant).

[ Itemize the technologies/techniques you researched independently and adopted in your project, i.e. aspects not covered in the lectures/labs. Include the source code filenames that illustrate these (we do not require code excerpts) and provide references to the online resources that helped you (articles/blogs).

## API Design
Give an overview of your web API design, perhaps similar to the following: 

|  |  GET | POST | PUT | DELETE
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- 
| /api/movies |Gets a list of movies | N/A | N/A |
| /api/movies/{movieid} | Get a Movie | N/A | N/A | N/A
| /api/movies/{movieid}/reviews | Get all reviews for movie | Create a new review for Movie | N/A | N/A  
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ...

If you have your API design on an online platform or graphic, please link to it (e.g. [Swaggerhub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/)).


## Security and Authentication
Give details of authentication/ security implemented on the API(e.g. passport/sessions). Indicate which routes are protected.

## Integrating with React App

Describe how you integrated your React app with the API. Perhaps link to the React App repo and give an example of an API call from React App. For example: 

~~~Javascript
export const getMovies = () => {
  return fetch(
     '/api/movies',{headers: {
       'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
    }
  }
  )
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => {return json.results;});
};

~~~

## Extra features

. . Briefly explain any non-standard features, functional or non-functional, developed for the app.  

## Independent learning

. . State the non-standard aspects of React/Express/Node (or other related technologies) that you researched and applied in this assignment . .
